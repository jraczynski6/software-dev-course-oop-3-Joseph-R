// This assignment in particular was a disaster.
// I ran into an issue where the code provided in main did not match the test code
// I do confess that I was not entirely aware of how imperative the order of the fields were.
// The issue lies in the fact that I even after fixing my mistake, the code did not work.
// This was frustrating, but I think it is the most effort i've put into a java assignment. It clicked.
